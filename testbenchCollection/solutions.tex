\section*{Solutions}

Timing: use frequency divider (Alex's grey counter) and a ring oscillator
can characterize 64 cells? only needs to change a single cell and wait for a while.\\
\\
Power: simply switch of the counter, let the ring oscillator run and measure the power. The only changes are within the ring oscillator, so over time the power gets more precise.\\

Area is of no concern
