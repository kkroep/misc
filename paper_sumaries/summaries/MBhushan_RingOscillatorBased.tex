\subsection*{Ring Oscillator Based TEchnique for Measuring Variability Statistics}
By: Manjul Bhushan\\

Use a ring oscillatopr to generate a certain frequency. Then a frequency divider is used to get the frequency down to a readable speed. One simply measures the frequency. Here the setup is used to caluclate the variances between identical components through different frabication instances.
